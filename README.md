# LockGame

This Python program simulates the Lock game played on a board between two players. Each player is represented by their own character. The objective of the game is to remove all of the opponent's pieces by locking them between one's own pieces. The game ends when a player's pieces are all removed from the board or when any row or column on the board becomes completely empty.
